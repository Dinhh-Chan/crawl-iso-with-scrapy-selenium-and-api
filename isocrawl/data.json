        "additional_content": "Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC\u00a01. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part\u00a02. The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75\u00a0%\u00a0of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. ISO/IEC\u00a025021  was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC\u00a01,  Information technology , Subcommittee SC\u00a07,  Software and System Engineering . This first edition of International Standard  ISO/IEC\u00a025021  cancels and replaces the first edition of Technical Report  ISO/IEC\u00a0TR\u00a025021:2007 . The SQuaRE series of standards consists of the following divisions under the general title  Systems and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) : ?  ISO/IEC\u00a02500n,  Quality Management Division , ?  ISO/IEC\u00a02501n,  Quality Model Division , ?  ISO/IEC\u00a02502n,  Quality Measurement Division , ?  ISO/IEC\u00a02503n,  Quality Requirements Division , and ?  ISO/IEC\u00a02504n,  Quality Evaluation Division . Introduction The purpose of this International Standard is to define and/or design an initial set of Quality Measure Elements (QME) to be used throughout the product life cycle for the purpose of Systems and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE). The document also gives a set of rules to design a QME or verify the design of an existing QME. The content of this document constitutes the link between the  ISO/IEC\u00a09126  series of standards and the subsequent SQuaRE series of standards. A number of QMEs for quality measures that quantify some of the characteristic and subcharacteristic represent an initial list, which is to be used during the construction of the quality measures as referenced in  ISO/IEC\u00a0TR\u00a09126-2 ,  ISO/IEC\u00a0TR\u00a09126-3  and  ISO/IEC\u00a0TR\u00a09126-4 . Quality measures presented in the SQuaRE series ( Figures\u00a01 ,  2 ) were extracted from  ISO/IEC\u00a0TR\u00a09126  series but it is not the only source. When evaluating selected quality measures, the user should first understand the definition of each property related to a QME used within the selected quality measures. The main purposes of defining and using the Quality Measures Elements (QMEs) in this document are: ?  To provide guidance for organisations developing and implementing their own QMEs; ?  To promote the consistent use of specific QME for measuring and using the product properties that are relevant to different product quality characteristics and subcharacteristics; ?  To help identify a set of QMEs that are uniquely required to derive all the quality measures for a given set of characteristics or a set of subcharacteristics of a product. The QMEs are the common components of a number of quality measures. The intended usage of this International standard is that users will be able to select and define relevant valid QMEs to define internal, external, data or quality-in-use quality measures. Then, these can be used for quality requirements definition, products evaluation and quality assessment but not necessary limited to those. It is therefore recommended to use this document prior or together with the ISO/IEC\u00a02502n series of standards. Figure\u00a01 \n?\n Organisation of the SQuaRE series of international standards Figure\u00a01  illustrates the organisation of the SQuaRE series representing families of standards, further called Divisions. Figure\u00a02 \n?\n Structure of the Quality Measurement Division Figure\u00a03 \n?\n The relationship of  ISO/IEC\u00a025021  as a link between the 9126 series and the SQuaRE series of standard The  ISO/IEC\u00a09126  series is composed of four documents that list and describe the characteristics, subcharacteristics and quality measures that are referred to as the quality model. The SQuaRE quality models categorize product quality into characteristics which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics and quality properties ( ISO/IEC\u00a025010 ). Each quality measure within  ISO/IEC\u00a09126  series is composed of at least two QMEs. The properties (of a product) are linked to the QME ( ISO/IEC\u00a025020 ), using a measurement method. The 2502n series designs and describes quality measures and associated QMEs for all the quality (sub)characteristics in the quality model. 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope This International Standard contains the following information: ?  Requirements for defining QMEs as part of the specification of the product quality requirements with examples (see  6.2 Tables\u00a01  and  2 ); NOTE  Product quality includes system quality, software product quality, data quality and eventually system service quality. ?  An initial set of QMEs, as examples (see  Annex\u00a0A Table\u00a0A.1 ); ?  A guideline for defining and quantifying the property of the product (target entity) for QMEs (see  Annex\u00a0B ) This document is intended for, but not limited to, developers, acquirers and independent evaluators of products, particularly those responsible for defining product quality requirements and for product evaluation. This International Standard is applicable when defining the QMEs to be used to implement quality measures such as those specified in ISO/IEC\u00a025022, ISO/IEC\u00a025023 and ISO/IEC\u00a025024.
